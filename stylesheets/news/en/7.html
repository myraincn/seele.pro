    <strong>Seele and Beosin form in-depth strategic cooperation to provide complete blockchain ecological security</strong>
    <br/><br/>
    2018-11-25<p/>
    <br>
      <p>On November 22, the underlying public chain Seele and Beosin (<a href="https://www.lianantech.com/#/">Chengdu Lianan Technology</a>) reached an agreement on in-depth strategic cooperation. The two parties will comprehensively create a new industry ecology in the field of blockchain security. As a leading enterprise focused on blockchain security, Beosin (Chengdu Lianan Technology) will provide a comprehensive solution from security development to formal verification for Seele and its smart contracts and DApp on the public chain. At the same time, both will jointly provide security for blockchain ecology.<br><br>
As the most representative underlying public chain in the industrial application field, Seele was originally created to enable industries and service entities. It is a prominent practitioner of blockchain technology to provide practical application value. It has pioneered the leading blockchain technology concepts, such as neural network consensus algorithm, heterogeneous forest network, and value network protocol (VNP). Up to now, the expansion in industries has covered the fields of medical, industrial Internet, and supply chain. Seele has published a series of yellow papers on blockchain research, providing guidance for future trends in the industry in the direction of cryptography, consensus algorithms, and network transmission. Dr. Maolin Zheng, the CEO of Seele said, “We are very pleased to cooperate with Beosin. Seele uses blockchain technology to effectively solve social value problems. Based on neural network consensus algorithms and underlying technologies, it helps more industries to implement technologies based on Seele. In the future, we will pay more attention to the development of global security ecology and technical cooperation.”<br><br>
Beosin (Chengdu Lianan Security Technology) CEO and Founder Xia Yang said, “Beosin has used the core technology of formal verification to achieve a great breakthrough in solving the security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It will make a great contribution to the construction of the global blockchain security ecosystem.”<br><br>
According to reports, Beosin is the first company in China to apply formal verification technology to the blockchain security field. With the “one-click” formal verification tool VaaS, more than 500 smart contracts have been audited and have been selected for Etherscan smart contract security audit recommendation. It provides smart contract security audit, wallet development and auditing, VaaS platform customization development, secure DApp development and auditing, secure smart contract development and auditing, exchange and public security platform security testing, and full ecological security services. In addition, Beosin has also obtained equity investments from well-known investment institutions as a security partner designated by more than 10 public chains such as ONT, Qtum, Bytom and Wanchain. Well-known investment institutions include Distributed Capital, Jieshi Capital, and Pangu Chuangfu.<br><br>
The successful cooperation between the two parties is an important measure for Seele’s industrial service arrangement of ecology security. It is also an important move for Beosin’s innovative business model in the blockchain ecological security industry.</p>
